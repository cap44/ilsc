Inteligent Lost Soul Cannon - DOOM2
The ILSC is a result of an accidental collab between 4/5 different youtubers, and 2 distinct comment threads,
This is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHerPNBByHE&lc=Ugyf9kjCGXNfb4Kj2XF4AaABAg 
This is the other: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHerPNBByHE&lc=Ugx-F2tb9qsw3wbYPo94AaABAg 

Now, what is the ILSC anyway?
The ILSC is a DECORATE-based modification for DOOM2 (G/ZDoom/Zandronum sourceports) that shoots 1 very special Lost Soul monster that attacks enemies in its sight.
Why just one and not more? 

That's just not to overload/break DOOM2's game design.
